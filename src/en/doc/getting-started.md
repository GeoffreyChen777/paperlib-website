# Getting Started

This article introduces how to use Paperlib.

## Library Folder

Open the preference window, choose a folder to store all your paper PDF files and the local database files. 

> ⚠️ If you are going to use the cloud sync feature, we recommend you to choose a shared folder such as Onedrive, Dropbox etc.

> ⚠️ If you use WebDAV to sync your library, this folder is used as the cache folder.

## Metadata Scrapers

We build a data pipeline to scrape the metadata from many databases for each paper. Many metadata scrapers are available. You can select your preferred scrapers in the preference window.

> ⚠️ Please choose a proper scraper combination for the best retrieval rate.

## Import New Papers

Drag and drop PDF files onto the main view of Paperlib. You can also import a paper from a website by clicking the [browser extension](./extensions/browser-extension).

## Metadata Retrieval

The metadata of each imported paper will be automaticlly scraped. Some papers may match nothing in the databases, thereby resulting in an empty/wrong paper item. You can manually edit its metadata by pressing `CTRL/CMD + E` or by clicking the edit button. Providing one of the title / DOI / arxivID and click the `Scrape` button to complete the rest is enough for most cases.

## Open / Preview a Paper

- Open a paper: double click an item in the main view. 
- Preview a paper: press `Space` or switch to the Table and Reader view.

## Tags / Folders
- Add: open the edit view, add or create your preferred tags and folders. You can also drag-drop an item to a tag/folder in the sidebar to add it to the tag/folder.
- Colorize: right click a tag or a folder in the sidebar list can change its color.

> By default, the `tag` is the inherent attributes of a paper such as `computer-vision`. The `folder` indicates the attributes given by users such as `good-writing`. But you can use them in any way you like. In Paperlib 3.0, we provide hierarchical folders.

## Locate Available PDF

For a paper without a PDF file, click the button called 'Locate' in the details panel to download the PDF file from internet.

Paperlib provides some PDF downloaders such as arXiv, Unpaywall etc.. For xxx-hub (that very famous paper download website XD), we cannot directly provide it because of the legal issue. You can manually input the URL of it in the `preference - downloader` to use it.

## Search

Paperlib provides three search modes: `general`, `fulltext`, and `advanced` mode. Click the button in the search bar to switch between them.

## Quick Copy-paste Plugin

When you are writing a paper, you can use the Quick Copy-paste Plugin to copy-paste the BibTex of a paper in your library. Just press `CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+I`, search a paper, and press `Enter`. Now, the BibTex is copied to your clipboard. You can also link this plugin to a folder. All papers copied by this plugin will be added to that folder. Thus, you can export all the BibTex once you finish writing your draft paper.

The Microsoft Word plugin is in Beta now.
