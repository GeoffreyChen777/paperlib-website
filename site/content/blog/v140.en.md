### Count of papers in the sidebar
For the count of papers in the sidebar, you can turn on/off it in the preference window.

### Drag items to add them to any tags or folders
Meanwhile, you can now drag items in the main list to the sidebar to add them to any tags or folders. Notablly, the drag area is relatively small (a small area of the right part of the list item) due to some technical limitations of the SwiftUI.
